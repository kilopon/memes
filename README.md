random weather app widget for obs
I'll prolly edit this once I get enough gifs, and test out other weather conditions

or just open it in your browser ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

how to :
just download the html file
open OBS, click add source, choose browser, click local file, locate the html. 

its done

should look like this in obs
